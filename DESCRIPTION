Description: Transforming univariate non-normal data to normality using
        Johnson families of distributions. Johnson family is a
        comprehensive distribution family that accommodates many kinds
        of non-normal distributions. A bunch of distributions with
        various parameters will be fit and the corresponding p-values
        under a user-specified normality test will be given. The final
        transformation will be the one with the largest p-value under
        the given normality test.
